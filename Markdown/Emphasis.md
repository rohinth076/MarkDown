# Strikethrough

You can strikethrough words by putting a horizontal line through the center of them. The result looks ~~like this~~. This feature allows you to indicate that certain words are a mistake not meant for inclusion in the document. To strikethrough words, use two tilde symbols (~~) before and after the words.

### <span style ="color:#9df9ef">  Example :
```md
~~Strike Through~~
```
### <span style ="color:#f75990"> Rendered Output 

> ~~Strike Through~~
